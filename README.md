The CSVs included in this repository include the temperature, potential temperature, and salinity values at various depths with correlation values added to give us a dataset heavily similar to ICOADS d548001 (see other repository [here](https://github.com/Owen-Jiang/ICOADS-Parser/tree/ds548.1-(Monthly-Summaries)) for more information). Averages have been taken over each month. Headers are T (temperature), Î¸ (potential temperature), and H (salinity). The entire dataset is very large (over 83 GB), take care when downloading. The Python program used to take apart the .nc data has also been provided.
